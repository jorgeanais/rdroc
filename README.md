# rdroc
Reddening and differential reddening in open clusters

## How it works
1. Load catalogs of star clusters from Vizier. To include a new catalog, add it to `catalogs.yaml` file folowing the same structure than the others. It will download automatically at start.

2. In the top left corner select the cluster from the drop down menu.

3. Enjoy.
